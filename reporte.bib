  Abstract                 = {Among the ideas to be conveyed to students in an introductory quantum course, we have the pivotal idea championed by Dirac that functions correspond to column vectors (kets) and that differential operators correspond to matrices (ket-bras) acting on those vectors. The MATLAB (matrix-laboratory) programming environment is especially useful in conveying these concepts to students because it is geared towards the type of matrix manipulations useful in solving introductory quantum physics problems. In this article, we share MATLAB codes which have been developed at WPI, focusing on 1D problems, to be used in conjunction with Griffiths' introductory text.},

Usually the physics student is distracted from understanding the concepts of modern physics by the need to master unfamiliar mathematics at the same time. In 39 Maple sessions presented in complete detail in the text and on the included diskette the reader explores many standard quantum mechanics problems, as well as some advanced topics, without tedious paperwork. At the same time a solid knowledge of Maple V is acquired as it applies to advanced mathematics relevant for engineering, physics, and applied mathematics. The diskette contains 39 Maple V for Windows worksheet files to reproduce all the problems presented in the text on a 486-based IBM-compatible PC, Macintosh, or Unix workstation running Maple V Release 3. The suggested exercises and further independent explorations can be performed with a minimum of typing. With minimal modifications in some worksheets, earlier Maple V releases may be used. Also, conversion to non-Windows Maple},

Most of our applications are devoted to nanoelectronics right now reaching from semiconductor device models to nanowire simulations. The online simulation facility has been operational for over ten years now and has served traditionally around 1,000 simulation users annually. The simulation tool delivery and the simulation tools have been completely overhauled in the past 18 months and over 4,200 users have run over 138,000 simulations. The introduction of interactive lectures on nanotechnology, in the form of tutorials, research seminars, and classes in the year 2004 has propelled the nanoHUB user base to over 18,700. The simulation tools available on the nanoHUB can address issues in quantum dots, resonant tunneling diodes, carbon nanotubes, PN-junctions, MOS capacitors, MOSFETs, nanowires, ultra-thin-body MOSFETs, and others. This short-course will overview usage scenarios from the perspectives of an undergraduate student, a post-doctoral researcher, and a faculty member, for education, research, and teaching, respectively.},

There are, also, typical learning physical problems that can not be completely explained and even understood using the blackboard, because
they present a kind of complex behaviors such as non linearties or many degrees of freedom. That is why they do not have any analytical
solution. In any case Computational Physics method is an alternative teaching tool what in practice contains all of the topics of basic
programming and numerical methods. In this paper we aboard some issues, enable us, to conform what we will call “algorithmic education”.
We present some traditional physics education problems, based on numerical and visual algorithms, for a better conceptual understanding
and models build up by the students it self. Just by using some elementary programming modules, we propose a strategy to build up models
starting from a pre-differential conceptual interpretation, which can be particularly useful in the firs period of university. The contribution
consists in by using a few mathematical elements and resources, students can make more and more complex simulation models. Specificall ,
for the implementation of the “algorithmic education ́ ́ we have used python, a programming language what permits the develop of themes
covering from the free particle movement, and damped harmonic oscillators, as well as the ideal or hard spheres gases and even Brownian
motion walks. In all of these cases the same elementary programming modules have been used.},
